## Why Q&A Streamliner is Essential?

Q&A sessions are a cornerstone in any event. They open avenues for engaging dialogue and foster a sense of involvement among the audience. But, as the event size increases, managing this critical part can turn daunting. 

- **Are you overwhelmed by volume?** Traditional Q&A systems struggle with hundreds, even thousands, of questions.
- **Missing out on meaningful exchanges?** Amidst a flood of queries, meaningful ones can get lost, leaving key discussions untapped.
- **Feeling the pinch of time and resources?** Manual sorting of questions can consume significant resources and time.
- **Need a tailored approach?** Traditional systems don't recognize the influence or expertise of individuals, often treating a vital question from a key participant as just another query.

This is where Q&A Streamliner comes to your rescue, presenting a much-needed solution to these challenges.
